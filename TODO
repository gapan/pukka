Make a proper install script

Provide information about dependencies that have been packaged, but are uninstalled

Tidy up -P functions

make -d fail gracefully

check if pickles out of date, refreshes data

I've got another feature request for pkgdepfinder, a search funciton along the lines of what's available in slapt-get  


 <gapan> uhm... here's a script that does that...                               
                       ¦12-12 11:24 <== <gapan> slapt-get --config slapt-getrc-14.0 --update                           
                       ¦12-12 11:24 <== <gapan> slapt-get --search $@                                                  
                       ¦12-12 11:24 <== <gapan> slapt-get --update                                                     
                       ¦12-12 11:25 <== <gapan> send everything from the 1st and 3rd to /dev/null and you have your    
                       ¦                slapt-get-search-for-14.0 ready                                                
                       ¦12-12 11:27 <== <gapan> oh, there's an even better way to do it...                             
                       ¦12-12 11:28 <== <mimosa> I thought of doing something like that                                
                       ¦12-12 11:28 <== <mimosa> but then I thought:                                                   
                       ¦12-12 11:28 <== <gapan> alias slapt-get14='slapt-get --config slapt-getrc-14.0'                
                       ¦12-12 11:28 <== <mimosa> it will interfere with slapt-get's normal database                    
                       ¦12-12 11:28 <== <gapan> and change the WORKINGDIR in that slapt-getrc-14.0 to point to         
                       ¦                something other than /var/slapt-get                                            
                       ¦12-12 11:29 <== <mimosa> ah ok                                                                 
                       ¦12-12 11:29 <== <gapan> so you have 2 slapt-gets                                               
                       ¦12-12 11:29 <== <gapan> the normal (14.1) one                                                  
                       ¦12-12 11:29 <== <gapan> and slapt-get14 for 14.0                                               
                       ¦12-12 11:42 <== <mimosa> gapan: yes, that works                                                
                       ¦12-12 11:44 <== <mimosa> it's a bit inefficient because my script's already downloading the    
                       ¦                PACKAGES.TXT                                                                   
                       ¦12-12 11:45 <== <mimosa> really, if I'm going to do things like this, I should ditch that part 
                       ¦                and just use slapt-get                                                         
                       ¦12-12 11:46 <== <mimosa> another tack: just do some regex in Python                            
                       ¦12-12 11:51 <== <mimosa> could be slow though                                                  
                       ¦12-12 11:54 <== <mimosa> I see slapt-get's package data mixes Salix and Slack repos, but they  
                       ¦                can still be distinguished by the pkgrel (anon in SLack)                       
                       ¦12-12 11:54 <== <mimosa> laprjns: see above for an easy workaround                             
                       ¦12-12 11:54 <== <mimosa> just make a sllapt-getrc_14.0 with a different workingdir             
                       ¦12-12 11:55 <== <mimosa> create the alias and you're good to go                                
                       ¦12-12 11:55 <== <mimosa> slapt-get14 --search jinja                                            
                       ¦12-12 11:56 <== <mimosa> I do agree this would fit in well with pkgdepcheck                    
                       ¦12-12 11:57 <== <mimosa> it needn't be a separate function - it could be called automatically  
                       ¦                if thre is no exact match                                                      
                       ¦12-12 11:58 <== <mimosa> really though, then I should rewrite the whole script to be parasitic 
                       ¦                on slapt-get                                                                   
                       ¦12-12 11:58 <== <mimosa> it would be much faster
